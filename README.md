SOFTWARE DEVELOPER - TECHNICAL TEST

Question A

Your goal for this question is to write a program that accepts two lines (x1,x2) and (x3,x4) on the x-axis and returns whether they overlap. As an example, (1,5) and (2,6) overlaps but not (1,5) and (6,8).

Solution:

function isOverlapR2(A,B) has been created to 
returns True if A Line overlaps B Line; False otherwise - Please check folder Test_A

usage: 
>>> from overlap import isOverlapR2

>>> print (isOverlapR2((1,5), (2,6)) )

True

>>> print (isOverlapR2((1,5), (6,8)) )

False


Question B

The goal of this question is to write a software library that accepts 2 version string as input and returns whether one is greater than, equal, or less than the other. As an example: “1.2” is greater than “1.1”. Please provide all test cases you could think of.

usage: 

>>> from compare import compareVersion

>>> a,b = '1.2', '1.1'

>>> print (compareVersion(a,b))

1.2 is greater than 1.1

>>> a,b = '1.2', '1.2'

>>> print (compareVersion(a,b))

1.2 is equal to 1.2

>>> a,b = '1.2', '1.3'

>>> print (compareVersion(a,b))

1.2 is less than 1.3

>>> a,b = '1.0', '1'

>>> print (compareVersion(a,b))
1.0 is equal to 1

** Note that are several assumptions for this question ** check README.md at test_B folder

Question C

Create an api that takes a string as input and returns a list of text insights from the top 5 google results of the query generated by those keywords. 

API has been setup using Flask + beautifulSoap + google

http://localhost:5000/  URL

** Note that are missing features and suggestions for this question C ** check README.md at test_C folder

Final note:

** Note that python 3 or above is required for all questions above; some extra packages, if required, are in requirements.txt  (pip install -r requirements.txt)
