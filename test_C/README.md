Architect solution (simplified)

Flask API + web scraping using python BeautifulSoap

Ref: https://github.com/miguelluiz/vanhack-quiz-C/blob/master/Simplified%20architecture.pptx

An API has been provided using Flask on http://localhost:5000/<url>

Preview
 
Software used

•	It has been tested against Microsoft Edge and Google Chrome

Virtual Environment under Windows 10 (64-bit) using Python 3.7.3

 
Required packages (included in requirements.txt)

beautifulsoup4==4.7.1

bs4==0.0.1

builtwith==1.3.3

Flask==1.0.2

Flask-Compress==1.4.0

google==2.0.2

Jinja2==2.10

requests==2.21.0

soupsieve==1.9


 
basic setup 

Make sure Python version is 3.7 or higher, then:

•	Download or clone from GitHub, then run the following command:

•	pip install -r requirements.txt

Missing features

•	Missing getting source code and images for a given URL

If the webpage has any source code and/or any image that might help the customer it will not show at the results.

Enhancements

•	Layout needs improvements

The given layout does a very basic task, therefore it has room to be improved. 

Ex: We do provide lots of links, so it would be worth to limit the number the links and add a bottom to help the user to decide whether he or she wants to see or not

Ex: Links could also be a real link and it is presented just as a text

•	Although BeautifulSoup can do most of the tasks at daily bases, Scrapy allow the solution to go even further


Copyright notice

•	Since there are sites that have strong restrictions against scrapping, in a real solution, this issue should be taken care
